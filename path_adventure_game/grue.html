        I told you it was dark. I warned you that you were likely to be eaten by a Grue.<br />
        But noooOOOOOoooo~ You just had to wait around in the dark like a buffoon.<br />
        Now look where doing stupid shit got you. Eaten. By a Grue.<br />
        JUST LIKE I WARNED! THE ONE TIME I WARN YOU AND YOU DON'T TAKE A HINT!!!
