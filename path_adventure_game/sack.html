      <h2>IT'S A TRAP!</h2>
      <p>
        Turns out rats like sacks. Also turns out rats don't like people opening the sacks they are in.<br />
        The rat claws and bites you to death. You should have probably kicked the sack or listened to your thoughts,<br />
        but it's too late now. You're dead.
